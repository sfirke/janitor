**janitor** has simple functions for examining and cleaning dirty data.
It was built with beginning and intermediate R users in mind and is
optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced R users can already do
everything covered here, but with janitor they can do it faster and save
their thinking for the fun stuff.

The main janitor functions:

  - perfectly format data.frame column names;
  - generate and format quick one- and two-variable tabulations (i.e.,
    frequency tables and crosstabs); and
  - isolate partially-duplicate records.

The tabulate-and-report functions approximate popular features of SPSS
and Microsoft Excel.

janitor is a
[\#tidyverse](https://github.com/hadley/tidyverse/blob/master/vignettes/manifesto.Rmd)-oriented
package. Specifically, it plays nicely with the `%>%` pipe and is
optimized for cleaning data brought in with the
[readr](https://github.com/hadley/readr) and
[readxl](https://github.com/hadley/readxl) packages.

## <i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> Getting Started

You can install:

  - the latest released version from CRAN with
    
    ``` r
    install.packages("janitor")
    ```

  - the latest development version from GitHub with
    
    ``` r
    if (packageVersion("devtools") < 1.6) {
      install.packages("devtools")
    }
    devtools::install_github("sfirke/janitor")
    ```

## <i class="fa fa-newspaper-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> What’s New

#### November 2017: Please try out the dev version\!

The current development version is significantly ahead of version 0.3.0
on CRAN (which was released May 2017). It has a greatly-enhanced
`tabyl()` function - see the [tabyls
vignette](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor/blob/master/vignettes/tabyls.md)
- and improvements to `clean_names()`. These `clean_names()`
improvements may cause old code to break, due to better handling of
variable names. More info is in the
[NEWS](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor/blob/master/NEWS.md) file; the
very quick fix is to supply the argument `case = "old_janitor"`.

## Using janitor

Below are quick examples of how janitor tools are commonly used. A full
description of each function can be found in janitor’s [catalog of
functions](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor/blob/master/vignettes/introduction.md).

### Cleaning dirty data

Take this roster of teachers at a fictional American high school, stored
in the Microsoft Excel file
[dirty\_data.xlsx](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor/blob/master/dirty_data.xlsx):
![All kinds of dirty.](reference/figures/dirty_data.PNG)

Dirtiness includes:

  - Dreadful column names
  - Rows and columns containing Excel formatting but no data
  - Dates stored as numbers
  - Values spread inconsistently over the “Certification” columns

Here’s that data after being read in to R:

``` r
library(pacman) # for loading packages
p_load(readxl, janitor, dplyr, here)

roster_raw <- read_excel(here("dirty_data.xlsx")) # available at http://github.com/sfirke/janitor
glimpse(roster_raw)
#> Observations: 13
#> Variables: 11
#> $ `First Name`        <chr> "Jason", "Jason", "Alicia", "Ada", "Desus", "Chien-Shiung", "Chien-Shiung", N...
#> $ `Last Name`         <chr> "Bourne", "Bourne", "Keys", "Lovelace", "Nice", "Wu", "Wu", NA, "Joyce", "Lam...
#> $ `Employee Status`   <chr> "Teacher", "Teacher", "Teacher", "Teacher", "Administration", "Teacher", "Tea...
#> $ Subject             <chr> "PE", "Drafting", "Music", NA, "Dean", "Physics", "Chemistry", NA, "English",...
#> $ `Hire Date`         <dbl> 39690, 39690, 37118, 27515, 41431, 11037, 11037, NA, 32994, 27919, 42221, 347...
#> $ `% Allocated`       <dbl> 0.75, 0.25, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 0.50, 0.50, NA, 0.50, 0.50, NA, NA, 0.80
#> $ `Full time?`        <chr> "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", NA, "No", "No", "No", "No", ...
#> $ `do not edit! --->` <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA
#> $ Certification       <chr> "Physical ed", "Physical ed", "Instr. music", "PENDING", "PENDING", "Science ...
#> $ Certification__1    <chr> "Theater", "Theater", "Vocal music", "Computers", NA, "Physics", "Physics", N...
#> $ Certification__2    <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA
```

Excel formatting led to an untitled empty column and 5 empty rows at the
bottom of the table (only 12 records have any actual data). Bad column
names are preserved.

Clean it with janitor functions:

``` r
roster <- roster_raw %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  remove_empty_rows() %>%
  remove_empty_cols() %>%
  mutate(hire_date = excel_numeric_to_date(hire_date),
         cert = coalesce(certification, certification_1)) %>% # from dplyr
  select(-certification, -certification_1) # drop unwanted columns

roster
#> # A tibble: 12 x 8
#>    first_name   last_name employee_status subject    hire_date  percent_allocated full_time cert          
#>    <chr>        <chr>     <chr>           <chr>      <date>                 <dbl> <chr>     <chr>         
#>  1 Jason        Bourne    Teacher         PE         2008-08-30             0.750 Yes       Physical ed   
#>  2 Jason        Bourne    Teacher         Drafting   2008-08-30             0.250 Yes       Physical ed

#>  8 James        Joyce     Teacher         English    1990-05-01             0.500 No        English 6-12  
#>  9 Hedy         Lamarr    Teacher         Science    1976-06-08             0.500 No        PENDING       
#> 10 Carlos       Boozer    Coach           Basketball 2015-08-05            NA     No        Physical ed   
#> 11 Young        Boozer    Coach           <NA>       1995-01-01            NA     No        Political sci.
#> 12 Micheal      Larsen    Teacher         English    2009-09-15             0.800 No        Vocal music
```

The core janitor cleaning function is `clean_names()` - call it whenever
you load data into R.

### Examining dirty data

#### Finding duplicates

Use `get_dupes()` to identify and examine duplicate records during data
cleaning. Let’s see if any teachers are listed more than once:

``` r
roster %>% get_dupes(first_name, last_name)
#> # A tibble: 4 x 9
#>   first_name   last_name dupe_count employee_status subject   hire_date  percent_allocated full_time cert    
#>   <chr>        <chr>          <int> <chr>           <chr>     <date>                 <dbl> <chr>     <chr>   
#> 1 Chien-Shiung Wu                 2 Teacher         Physics   1930-03-20             0.500 Yes       Science~
#> 2 Chien-Shiung Wu                 2 Teacher         Chemistry 1930-03-20             0.500 Yes       Science~
#> 3 Jason        Bourne             2 Teacher         PE        2008-08-30             0.750 Yes       Physica~
#> 4 Jason        Bourne             2 Teacher         Drafting  2008-08-30             0.250 Yes       Physica~
```

Yes, some teachers appear twice. We ought to address this before
counting employees.

#### Tabulating tools

A variable (or combinations of two or three variables) can be tabulated
with `tabyl()`. The resulting data.frame can be tweaked and formatted
with the suite of `adorn_` functions for quick analysis and printing of
pretty results in a report. `adorn_` functions can be helpful with
non-tabyls, too.

`tabyl` can be called two ways:

  - On a vector, when tabulating a single variable - e.g.,
    `tabyl(roster$subject)`
  - On a data.frame, specifying 1, 2, or 3 variable names to tabulate :
    `roster %>% tabyl(subject, employee_status)`.
      - Here the data.frame is passed in with the `%>%` pipe; this
        allows for dplyr commands earlier in the pipeline

##### tabyl()

Like `table()`, but pipe-able, data.frame-based, and fully featured.

One variable:

``` r
roster %>%
  tabyl(subject)
#>     subject n    percent valid_percent
#>  Basketball 1 0.08333333           0.1
#>   Chemistry 1 0.08333333           0.1
#>        Dean 1 0.08333333           0.1
#>    Drafting 1 0.08333333           0.1
#>     English 2 0.16666667           0.2
#>       Music 1 0.08333333           0.1
#>          PE 1 0.08333333           0.1
#>     Physics 1 0.08333333           0.1
#>     Science 1 0.08333333           0.1
#>        <NA> 2 0.16666667            NA
```

Two variables:

``` r
roster %>%
  filter(hire_date > as.Date("1950-01-01")) %>%
  tabyl(employee_status, full_time)
#>  employee_status No Yes
#>   Administration  0   1
#>            Coach  2   0
#>          Teacher  3   4
```

Three variables:

``` r
roster %>%
  tabyl(full_time, subject, employee_status)
#> $Administration
#>  full_time Basketball Chemistry Dean Drafting English Music PE Physics Science
#>         No          0         0    0        0       0     0  0       0       0
#>        Yes          0         0    1        0       0     0  0       0       0
#> 
#> $Coach
#>  full_time Basketball Chemistry Dean Drafting English Music PE Physics Science NA_
#>         No          1         0    0        0       0     0  0       0       0   1
#>        Yes          0         0    0        0       0     0  0       0       0   0
#> 
#> $Teacher
#>  full_time Basketball Chemistry Dean Drafting English Music PE Physics Science NA_
#>         No          0         0    0        0       2     0  0       0       1   0
#>        Yes          0         1    0        1       0     1  1       1       0   1
```

##### Adorning tabyls

The suite of `adorn_` functions dress up the results of these tabulation
calls for fast, basic reporting. Here are some of the functions that
augment a summary table for reporting:

``` r
roster %>%
  tabyl(employee_status, full_time) %>%
  adorn_totals("row") %>%
  adorn_percentages("row") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>%
  adorn_ns()
#>  employee_status         No        Yes
#>   Administration   0.0% (0) 100.0% (1)
#>            Coach 100.0% (2)   0.0% (0)
#>          Teacher  33.3% (3)  66.7% (6)
#>            Total  41.7% (5)  58.3% (7)
```

Pipe that right into `knitr::kable()` in your RMarkdown report\!

These modular adornments can be layered to reduce R’s deficit against
Excel and SPSS when it comes to quick, informative counts.
