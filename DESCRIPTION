Description: The main janitor functions can: perfectly format data.frame column
    names; provide quick counts of variable combinations (i.e., frequency
    tables and crosstabs); and isolate duplicate records. Other janitor functions
    nicely format the tabulation results. These tabulate-and-report functions
    approximate popular features of SPSS and Microsoft Excel. This package
    follows the principles of the "tidyverse" and works well with the pipe function
    %>%. janitor was built with beginning-to-intermediate R users in mind and is
    optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced R users can already do everything
    covered here, but with janitor they can do it faster and save their thinking for
    the fun stuff.
