Package: janitor
Title: Simple Tools for Examining and Cleaning Dirty Data
Version: 0.2.0.9000
Authors@R: c(person("Sam", "Firke", email = "samuel.firke@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre")),
    person("Chris", "Haid", email = "chrishaid@gmail.com", role = "ctb"))
Description: The main janitor functions can: perfectly format data.frame column
    names; isolate duplicate records; and provide quick one- and two-variable
    tabulations (i.e., frequency tables and crosstabs). Other janitor functions
    nicely format the results of these tabulations. These tabulate-and-report
    functions approximate popular features of SPSS and Microsoft Excel. This package
    follows the principles of the "tidyverse" and works well with the pipe function
    %>%. janitor was built with beginning-to-intermediate R users in mind and is
    optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced R users can already do everything
    covered here, but with janitor they can do it faster and save their thinking for
    the fun stuff.
