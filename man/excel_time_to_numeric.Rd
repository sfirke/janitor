Convert a time that may be inconsistently or inconveniently formatted from
Microsoft Excel to a numeric number of seconds between 0 and 86400.
}
\details{
\code{time_value} may be one of the following formats:
\itemize{
\item{numeric}{The input must be a value from 0 to 1 (exclusive of 1); this value is returned as-is.}
\item{POSIXlt or POSIXct}{The input must be on the day 1899-12-31 (any other day will cause an error).  The time of day is extracted and converted to a fraction of a day.}
\item{character}{Any of the following (or a mixture of the choices):}
\itemize{
\item{A character string that is a number between 0 and 1 (exclusive of 1).  This value will be converted like a numeric value.}
\item{A character string that looks like a date on 1899-12-31 (specifically, it must start with \code{"1899-12-31 "}), converted like a POSIXct object as described above.}
\item{A character string that looks like a time.  Choices are 12-hour time as hour, minute, and optionally second followed by "am" or "pm" (case insensitive) or 24-hour time when hour, minute, optionally second, and no "am" or "pm" is included.}
