\title{Append a totals row and/or column to a data.frame}
\usage{
adorn_totals(dat, where = "row", fill = "-", na.rm = TRUE, name = "Total", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{An input \code{data.frame} with at least one numeric column. If given a
list of data.frames, this function will apply itself to each \code{data.frame}
in the list (designed for 3-way \code{tabyl} lists).}

\item{where}{One of "row", "col", or \code{c("row", "col")}}

\item{fill}{If there are non-numeric columns, what should fill the bottom row
of those columns? If a string, relevant columns will be coerced to character.
If \code{NA} then column types are preserved.}

\item{na.rm}{Should missing values (including \code{NaN}) be omitted from the calculations?}

\item{name}{Name of the totals row and/or column.  If both are created, and
\code{name} is a single string, that name is applied to both. If both are created
and \code{name} is a vector of length 2, the first element of the vector will be
used as the row name (in column 1), and the second element will be used as the
totals column name. Defaults to "Total".}

\item{...}{Columns to total.  This takes a tidyselect specification. By default,
all numeric columns (besides the initial column, if numeric) are included in
the totals, but this allows you to manually specify which columns should be
included, for use on a data.frame that does not result from a call to \code{tabyl}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} augmented with a totals row, column, or both.
The \code{data.frame} is now also of class \code{tabyl} and stores information about
the attached totals and underlying data in the tabyl attributes.
}
\description{
This function defaults to excluding the first column of the input data.frame,
assuming that it contains a descriptive variable, but this can be overridden
by specifying the columns to be totaled in the \code{...} argument. Non-numeric
columns are converted to character class and have a user-specified fill character
inserted in the totals row.
