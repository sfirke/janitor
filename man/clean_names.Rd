\arguments{
\item{dat}{The input \code{data.frame}.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=make_clean_names]{make_clean_names}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{case}}{The desired target case (default is \code{"snake"}) will be
passed to \code{snakecase::to_any_case()} with the exception of "old_janitor",
which exists only to support legacy code (it preserves the behavior of
\code{clean_names()} prior to addition of the "case" argument (janitor
versions <= 0.3.1).  "old_janitor" is not intended for new code. See
\code{\link[snakecase:to_any_case]{snakecase::to_any_case()}} for a wide variety of supported cases,
including "sentence" and "title" case.}
    \item{\code{replace}}{A named character vector where the name is replaced by the
value.}
    \item{\code{ascii}}{Convert the names to ASCII (\code{TRUE}, default) or not
(\code{FALSE}).}
    \item{\code{use_make_names}}{Should \code{make.names()} be applied to ensure that the
output is usable as a name without quoting?  (Avoiding \code{make.names()}
ensures that the output is locale-independent but quoting may be required.)}
    \item{\code{allow_dupes}}{Allow duplicates in the returned names (\code{TRUE}) or not
(\code{FALSE}, the default).}
    \item{\code{sep_in}}{(short for separator input) if character, is interpreted as a
regular expression (wrapped internally into \code{stringr::regex()}). 
The default value is a regular expression that matches any sequence of
non-alphanumeric values. All matches will be replaced by underscores 
(additionally to \code{"_"} and \code{" "}, for which this is always true, even
if \code{NULL} is supplied). These underscores are used internally to split
the strings into substrings and specify the word boundaries.}
    \item{\code{parsing_option}}{An integer that will determine the parsing_option.
\itemize{
 \item{1: \code{"RRRStudio" -> "RRR_Studio"}}
 \item{2: \code{"RRRStudio" -> "RRRS_tudio"}}
 \item{3: \code{"RRRStudio" -> "RRRSStudio"}. This will become for example \code{"Rrrstudio"} when we convert to lower camel case.}
 \item{-1, -2, -3: These \code{parsing_options}'s will suppress the conversion after non-alphanumeric values.}
 \item{0: no parsing}
 }}
    \item{\code{transliterations}}{A character vector (if not \code{NULL}). The entries of this argument
need to be elements of \code{stringi::stri_trans_list()} (like "Latin-ASCII", which is often useful) or names of lookup tables (currently only "german" is supported). In the order of the entries the letters of the input
 string will be transliterated via \code{stringi::stri_trans_general()} or replaced via the 
 matches of the lookup table. When named character elements are supplied as part of `transliterations`, anything that matches the names is replaced by the corresponding value.
You should use this feature with care in case of \code{case = "parsed"}, \code{case = "internal_parsing"} and 
\code{case = "none"}, since for upper case letters, which have transliterations/replacements
 of length 2, the second letter will be transliterated to lowercase, for example Oe, Ae, Ss, which
 might not always be what is intended. In this case you can make usage of the option to supply named elements and specify the transliterations yourself.}
    \item{\code{numerals}}{A character specifying the alignment of numerals (\code{"middle"}, \code{left}, \code{right}, \code{asis} or \code{tight}). I.e. \code{numerals = "left"} ensures that no output separator is in front of a digit.}
  }}

\item{set_labels}{If set to \code{TRUE}, old names are stored as labels in each column of the returned data.frame.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with clean names.
}
\description{
Resulting names are unique and consist only of the \verb{_} character, numbers, and letters.
Capitalization preferences can be specified using the \code{case} parameter.

Accented characters are transliterated to ASCII.  For example, an "o" with a
German umlaut over it becomes "o", and the Spanish character "enye" becomes
"n".

This function takes and returns a data.frame, for ease of piping with
\verb{\%>\%}. For the underlying function that works on a character vector
of names, see \code{\link[=make_clean_names]{make_clean_names()}}.  \code{clean_names}
relies on the versatile function \code{\link[snakecase:to_any_case]{snakecase::to_any_case()}}, which
accepts many arguments.  See that function's documentation for ideas on getting
the most out of \code{clean_names}.  A few examples are included below.

A common issue is that the micro/mu symbol is replaced by "m" instead of "u".
The replacement with "m" is more correct when doing Greek-to-ASCII
transliteration but less correct when doing scientific data-to-ASCII
transliteration.  A warning will be generated if the "m" replacement occurs.
To replace with "u", please add the argument \code{replace=janitor:::mu_to_u}
which is a character vector mapping all known mu or micro Unicode code points
(characters) to "u".

\details{
\code{clean_names()} is intended to be used on \code{data.frames}
and \code{data.frame}-like objects. For this reason there are methods to
support using \code{clean_names()} on \code{sf} and \code{tbl_graph} (from
\code{tidygraph}) objects as well as on database connections through
\code{dbplyr}. For cleaning other named objects like named lists
and vectors, use \code{make_clean_names()}. When \code{set_labels} is set to \code{TRUE}, the old names,
stored as column labels, can be restored using \code{sjlabelled::label_to_colnames()}.

\examples{

# --- Simple Usage ---
x <- data.frame(caseID = 1, DOB = 2, Other = 3)
clean_names(x)

# or pipe in the input data.frame:
x \%>\%
  clean_names()

# if you prefer camelCase variable names:
x \%>\%
  clean_names(., "lower_camel")

# (not run) run clean_names after reading in a spreadsheet:
# library(readxl)
# read_excel("messy_excel_file.xlsx") \%>\%
#   clean_names()

# --- Taking advantage of the underlying snakecase::to_any_case arguments ---

# Restore column names to Title Case, e.g., for plotting
mtcars \%>\%
  clean_names(case = "title")

# Tell clean_names to leave certain abbreviations untouched:
x \%>\%
  clean_names(case = "upper_camel", abbreviations = c("ID", "DOB"))
