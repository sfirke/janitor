\title{Add \code{tabyl} attributes to a data.frame}
\usage{
as_tabyl(dat, axes = 2, row_var_name = NULL, col_var_name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{a data.frame with variable values in the first column and numeric
values in all other columns.}

\item{axes}{is this a two_way tabyl or a one_way tabyl?  If this function is
being called by a user, this should probably be "2".  One-way tabyls are
created by \code{tabyl} but are a special case.}

\item{row_var_name}{(optional) the name of the variable in the row dimension;
used by \code{adorn_title()}.}

\item{col_var_name}{(optional) the name of the variable in the column
dimension; used by \code{adorn_title()}.}
}
\value{
Returns the same data.frame, but with the additional class of "tabyl"
and the attribute "core".
}
\description{
A \code{tabyl} is a \code{data.frame} containing counts of a variable or
co-occurrences of two variables (a.k.a., a contingency table or crosstab).
This specialized kind of data.frame has attributes that enable \code{adorn_}
functions to be called for precise formatting and presentation of results.
E.g., display results as a mix of percentages, Ns, add totals rows or
columns, rounding options, in the style of Microsoft Excel PivotTable.

A \code{tabyl} can be the result of a call to \code{janitor::tabyl()}, in which case
these attributes are added automatically.  This function adds \code{tabyl} class
attributes to a data.frame that isn't the result of a call to \code{tabyl} but
meets the requirements of a two-way tabyl: 1) First column contains values of
variable 1 2) Column names 2:n are the values of variable 2 3) Numeric values
in columns 2:n are counts of the co-occurrences of the two variables.*
\itemize{
\item = this is the ideal form of a \code{tabyl}, but janitor's \code{adorn_} functions tolerate
and ignore non-numeric columns in positions 2:n.
}

For instance, the result of \code{\link[dplyr:count]{dplyr::count()}} followed by \code{\link[tidyr:pivot_wider]{tidyr::pivot_wider()}}
can be treated as a \code{tabyl}.

The result of calling \code{\link[=tabyl]{tabyl()}} on a single variable is a special class of
one-way tabyl; this function only pertains to the two-way tabyl.
