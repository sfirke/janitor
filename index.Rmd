**janitor** has simple functions for examining and cleaning dirty data.  It was built with beginning and intermediate R users in mind and is optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced R users can already do everything covered here, but with janitor they can do it faster and save their thinking for the fun stuff.

The main janitor functions:

* perfectly format data.frame column names;
* create and format frequency tables of one, two, or three variables - think an improved `table()`; and
* provide other tools for cleaning and examining data.frames.

The tabulate-and-report functions approximate popular features of SPSS and Microsoft Excel.

janitor is a [#tidyverse](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html)-oriented package.  Specifically, it plays nicely with the `%>%` pipe and is optimized for cleaning data brought in with the [readr](https://github.com/tidyverse/readr) and [readxl](https://github.com/tidyverse/readxl) packages.


## <i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i> Getting Started


You can install:

* the most recent officially-released version from CRAN with

    ```R
    install.packages("janitor")
    ````

* the latest development version from GitHub with

    ```R
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("sfirke/janitor")
    ```

## Using janitor

A full description of each function, organized by topic, can be found in janitor's [catalog of functions vignette](https://sfirke.github.io/janitor/articles/janitor.html).  There you will find functions not mentioned in this README, like `compare_df_cols()` which provides a summary of differences in column names and types when given a set of data.frames.

Below are quick examples of how janitor tools are commonly used. 

### Cleaning dirty data

Take this roster of teachers at a fictional American high school, stored in the Microsoft Excel file [dirty_data.xlsx](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor/blob/master/dirty_data.xlsx):
![All kinds of dirty.](man/figures/dirty_data.PNG)

Dirtiness includes:

* A header at the top
* Dreadful column names
* Rows and columns containing Excel formatting but no data
* Dates in two different formats in a single column (MM/DD/YYYY and numbers)
* Values spread inconsistently over the "Certification" columns

Here's that data after being read in to R:
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(readxl); library(janitor); library(dplyr); library(here)

roster_raw <- read_excel(here("dirty_data.xlsx")) # available at https://github.com/sfirke/janitor
glimpse(roster_raw)
```

Now, to clean it up, starting with the column names.

Name cleaning comes in two flavors. `make_clean_names()` operates on character vectors and can be used during data import:
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
roster_raw_cleaner <- read_excel(here("dirty_data.xlsx"), 
                                 skip = 1,
                                 .name_repair = make_clean_names)
glimpse(roster_raw_cleaner)
```

`clean_names()` is a convenience version of `make_clean_names()` that can be used for piped data.frame workflows.  The equivalent steps with `clean_names()` would be:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
roster_raw <- roster_raw %>%
  row_to_names(row_number = 1) %>%
  clean_names()
```

The data.frame now has clean names.  Let's tidy it up further:

```{r}
roster <- roster_raw %>%
  remove_empty(c("rows", "cols")) %>%
  remove_constant(na.rm = TRUE, quiet = FALSE) %>% # remove the column of all "Yes" values 
  mutate(hire_date = convert_to_date(hire_date, # handle the mixed-format dates
                                     character_fun = lubridate::mdy),
         cert = dplyr::coalesce(certification, certification_2)) %>%
  select(-certification, -certification_2) # drop unwanted columns

roster
```


### Examining dirty data

#### Finding duplicates
Use `get_dupes()` to identify and examine duplicate records during data cleaning.  Let's see if any teachers are listed more than once:
```{r}
roster %>% get_dupes(contains("name"))
```

Yes, some teachers appear twice.  We ought to address this before counting employees.

#### Tabulating tools
A variable (or combinations of two or three variables) can be tabulated with `tabyl()`.  The resulting data.frame can be tweaked and formatted
with the suite of `adorn_` functions for quick analysis and printing of pretty results in a report.  `adorn_` functions can be helpful with non-tabyls, too.

#### tabyl()

Like `table()`, but pipe-able, data.frame-based, and fully featured.

`tabyl` can be called two ways:

* On a vector, when tabulating a single variable: `tabyl(roster$subject)`
* On a data.frame, specifying 1, 2, or 3 variable names to tabulate: `roster %>% tabyl(subject, employee_status)`.
    * Here the data.frame is passed in with the `%>%` pipe; this allows `tabyl` to be used in an analysis pipeline
    
One variable:
```{r}
roster %>%
  tabyl(subject)
```

Two variables:
```{r}
roster %>%
  filter(hire_date > as.Date("1950-01-01")) %>%
  tabyl(employee_status, full_time)
```

Three variables:
```{r}
roster %>%
  tabyl(full_time, subject, employee_status, show_missing_levels = FALSE)
```

**Adorning tabyls**

The `adorn_` functions dress up the results of these tabulation calls for fast, basic reporting.  Here are some of the functions that augment a summary table for reporting:

```{r}
roster %>%
  tabyl(employee_status, full_time) %>%
  adorn_totals("row") %>%
  adorn_percentages("row") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>%
  adorn_ns() %>%
  adorn_title("combined")

```

Pipe that right into `knitr::kable()` in your RMarkdown report.

These modular adornments can be layered to reduce R's deficit against Excel and SPSS when it comes to quick, informative counts.  Learn more about `tabyl()` and the `adorn_` functions from the [tabyls vignette](https://sfirke.github.io/janitor/articles/tabyls.html).
