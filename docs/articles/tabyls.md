Motivation: why tabyl?
----------------------

Analysts do a lot of counting. Indeed, it’s been said that “[data
science is mostly counting
things](https://twitter.com/joelgrus/status/833691273873600512).” But
the base R function for counting, `table()`, leaves much to be desired:

-   It doesn’t accept data.frame inputs (and thus doesn’t play nicely
    with the tidyverse)
-   It doesn’t output data.frames
-   Its results are hard to format. Compare the look and formatting
    choices of an R table to a Microsoft Excel PivotTable or even the
    table formatting provided by SPSS.

`tabyl()` is an approach to tabulating variables that addresses these
shortcomings. It’s part of the janitor package because counting is such
a fundamental part of data cleaning and exploration.

`tabyl()` is tidyverse-aligned and is primarily built upon the dplyr and
tidyr packages.

How it works
------------

On its surface, `tabyl()` produces frequency tables using 1, 2, or 3
variables. Under the hood, `tabyl()` also attaches a copy of these
counts as an attribute of the resulting data.frame.

The result looks like a basic data.frame of counts, but because it’s
also a `tabyl` containing this metadata, you can use `adorn_` functions
to add additional information and pretty formatting.

Examples
========

This vignette demonstrates `tabyl` in the context of studying humans in
the `starwars` dataset from dplyr:

``` r
library(dplyr)
humans <- starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human")
```

### Installing

The features of `tabyl()` shown here are in the development version of
janitor on GitHub and are not on CRAN yet. You can install the dev
version with `devtools::install_github("sfirke/janitor")`.

One-way tabyl
-------------

Tabulating a single variable is the simplest kind of tabyl:

``` r
library(janitor)

t1 <- humans %>%
  tabyl(eye_color)

t1
#>  eye_color  n    percent
#>       blue 12 0.34285714
#>  blue-gray  1 0.02857143
#>      brown 17 0.48571429
#>       dark  1 0.02857143
#>      hazel  2 0.05714286
#>     yellow  2 0.05714286
```

When `NA` values are present, `tabyl()` also displays “valid”
percentages, i.e., with missing values removed from the denominator. And
while `tabyl()` is built to take a data.frame and column names, you can
also produce a one-way tabyl by calling it directly on a vector:

``` r
x <- c("big", "big", "small", "small", "small", NA)
tabyl(x)
#>      x n   percent valid_percent
#>    big 2 0.3333333           0.4
#>  small 3 0.5000000           0.6
#>   <NA> 1 0.1666667            NA
```

Most `adorn_` helper functions are built for 2-way tabyls, but those
that make sense for a 1-way tabyl do work:

``` r
t1 %>%
  adorn_totals("row") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting()
#>  eye_color  n percent
#>       blue 12   34.3%
#>  blue-gray  1    2.9%
#>      brown 17   48.6%
#>       dark  1    2.9%
#>      hazel  2    5.7%
#>     yellow  2    5.7%
#>      Total 35  100.0%
```

Two-way tabyl
-------------

This is often called a “crosstab” or “contingency” table. The initial
call produces the same result as the common combination of
`dplyr::count()`, followed by `tidyr::spread()` to wide form:

``` r
t2 <- humans %>%
  tabyl(gender, eye_color)

t2
#>  gender blue blue-gray brown dark hazel yellow
#>  female    3         0     5    0     1      0
#>    male    9         1    12    1     1      2
```

Since it’s a `tabyl`, we can enhance it with `adorn_` helper functions.
For instance:

``` r

t2 %>%
  adorn_percentages("row") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 2) %>%
  adorn_ns()
#>  gender       blue blue-gray       brown      dark      hazel    yellow
#>  female 33.33% (3) 0.00% (0) 55.56%  (5) 0.00% (0) 11.11% (1) 0.00% (0)
#>    male 34.62% (9) 3.85% (1) 46.15% (12) 3.85% (1)  3.85% (1) 7.69% (2)
```

Adornments have options to control axes, rounding, and other relevant
formatting choices (more on that below).

Three-way tabyl
---------------

Just as `table()` accepts three variables, so does `tabyl()`, producing
a list of tabyls:

``` r
t3 <- humans %>%
  tabyl(eye_color, skin_color, gender)

t3 # the result is a tabyl of eye color x skin color, split into a list by gender
#> $female
#>  eye_color dark fair light pale tan white
#>       blue    0    2     1    0   0     0
#>  blue-gray    0    0     0    0   0     0
#>      brown    0    1     4    0   0     0
#>       dark    0    0     0    0   0     0
#>      hazel    0    0     1    0   0     0
#>     yellow    0    0     0    0   0     0
#> 
#> $male
#>  eye_color dark fair light pale tan white
#>       blue    0    7     2    0   0     0
#>  blue-gray    0    1     0    0   0     0
#>      brown    3    4     3    0   2     0
#>       dark    1    0     0    0   0     0
#>      hazel    0    1     0    0   0     0
#>     yellow    0    0     0    1   0     1
```

If called on a list of data.frames - like the output of a three-way
`tabyl` call - the `adorn_` helper functions will apply themselves to
each data.frame:

``` r
library(purrr)
humans %>%
  tabyl(eye_color, skin_color, gender, show_missing_levels = FALSE) %>%
  adorn_totals("row") %>%
  adorn_percentages("all") %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>%
  adorn_ns %>%
  adorn_title
#> $female
#>            skin_color          
#>  eye_color       fair     light
#>       blue  22.2% (2) 11.1% (1)
#>      brown  11.1% (1) 44.4% (4)
#>      hazel   0.0% (0) 11.1% (1)
#>      Total  33.3% (3) 66.7% (6)
#> 
#> $male
#>            skin_color                                                
#>  eye_color       dark       fair     light     pale      tan    white
#>       blue   0.0% (0) 26.9%  (7)  7.7% (2) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0)
#>  blue-gray   0.0% (0)  3.8%  (1)  0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0)
#>      brown  11.5% (3) 15.4%  (4) 11.5% (3) 0.0% (0) 7.7% (2) 0.0% (0)
#>       dark   3.8% (1)  0.0%  (0)  0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0)
#>      hazel   0.0% (0)  3.8%  (1)  0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0) 0.0% (0)
#>     yellow   0.0% (0)  0.0%  (0)  0.0% (0) 3.8% (1) 0.0% (0) 3.8% (1)
#>      Total  15.4% (4) 50.0% (13) 19.2% (5) 3.8% (1) 7.7% (2) 3.8% (1)
```

These functions automatically call `purrr::map()` internally to support
interactive data analysis that switches between 2 and 3 variables. That
way, if a user starts with `humans %>% tabyl(eye_color, skin_color)`,
adds some `adorn_` calls, then decides to split the tabulation by gender
and modifies their first line to
`humans %>% tabyl(eye_color, skin_color, gender`), they don’t have to
refactor the subsequent adornment calls to use `map()`.

However, if feels more natural to call these with `purrr::map()` or
`lapply()`, that is still supported. For instance,
`t3 %>% lapply(adorn_percentages)` would produce the same result as
`t3 %>% adorn_percentages`.

### Other features of tabyls

-   When called on a factor, it will include missing levels (levels not
    present in the data) in the result
    -   This can be suppressed if not desired
-   `NA` values can be displayed or suppressed
-   Prints without displaying row numbers

`adorn_*` functions
-------------------

These modular functions build on a `tabyl` to approximate the
functionality of a quick PivotTable in Microsoft Excel. They print
elegant results for interactive analysis or for sharing in a report,
e.g., with `knitr::kable()`. For example:

``` r
humans %>%
  tabyl(gender, eye_color) %>%
  adorn_totals(c("row", "col")) %>%
  adorn_percentages("row") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(rounding = "half up", digits = 0) %>%
  adorn_ns() %>%
  adorn_title("combined") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| gender/eye\_color | blue     | blue-gray | brown    | dark   | hazel   | yellow | Total     |
|:------------------|:---------|:----------|:---------|:-------|:--------|:-------|:----------|
| female            | 33% (3)  | 0% (0)    | 56% (5)  | 0% (0) | 11% (1) | 0% (0) | 100% (9)  |
| male              | 35% (9)  | 4% (1)    | 46% (12) | 4% (1) | 4% (1)  | 8% (2) | 100% (26) |
| Total             | 34% (12) | 3% (1)    | 49% (17) | 3% (1) | 6% (2)  | 6% (2) | 100% (35) |

### The adorn functions are:

-   **`adorn_totals()`**: Add totals row, column, or both. Replaces the
    janitor functions `add_totals_row` and `add_totals_col`
-   **`adorn_percentages()`**: Calculate percentages along either axis
    or over the entire tabyl
-   **`adorn_pct_formatting()`**: Format percentage columns, controlling
    number of digits to display and whether to append the `%` symbol
-   **`adorn_rounding()`**: Round a data.frame of numbers (usually the
    result of `adorn_percentages`), either using the base R `round()`
    function or rounding all ties up using a custom rounding function
    ([thanks,
    StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12688836/4470365)).
    -   e.g., round 10.5 up to 11, consistent with Excel’s tie-breaking
        behavior.
        -   This contrasts with rounding 10.5 down to 10 as in base R’s
            `round(10.5)`.
    -   `adorn_rounding()` outputs retain the class `numeric`, allowing
        for graphing, sorting, etc. It’s a less-aggressive substitute
        for `adorn_pct_formatting()`; these two functions should not be
        called together.
-   **`adorn_ns()`**: add Ns to a tabyl. These can be drawn from the
    tabyl’s `core` attribute (by default), or supplied by the user.
-   **`adorn_title()`**: add a title to a tabyl (or other data.frame).
    Options include putting the column title in a new row on top of the
    data.frame or combining the row and column titles in the
    data.frame’s first name slot.

These adornments should be called in a logical order, e.g., you probably
want to add totals before percentages are calculated. In general, call
them in the order they appear above.

Users of janitor version &lt;= 0.3.0 should replace the deprecated
`adorn_crosstab()` function with combinations of the above `adorn_`
functions.

BYOt (Bring Your Own tabyl)
---------------------------

You can also call `adorn_` functions on other data.frames, not only the
results of calls to `tabyl()`. E.g.,
`mtcars %>% adorn_totals("col") %>% adorn_percentages("col")` performs
as expected, despite `mtcars` not being a `tabyl`.

This can be handy when you have a data.frame that is not a simple
tabulation generated by `tabyl` but would still benefit from the
`adorn_` formatting functions.

A simple example: formatting percentages in a data.frame showing the %
of records meeting a certain condition:

``` r
percent_above_165_cm <- humans %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(pct_above_165_cm = mean(height > 165, na.rm = TRUE))

percent_above_165_cm %>%
  adorn_pct_formatting()
#> # A tibble: 2 x 2
#>   gender pct_above_165_cm
#>   <chr>  <chr>           
#> 1 female 12.5%           
#> 2 male   100.0%
```

Here’s a more complex example. We’ll create a table containing the mean
of a 3rd variable when grouped by two other variables, then use `adorn_`
functions to round the values and append Ns. The first part is pretty
straightforward:

``` r
library(tidyr) # for spread()
mpg_by_cyl_and_am <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl, am) %>%
  summarise(mpg = mean(mpg)) %>%
  spread(am, mpg)

mpg_by_cyl_and_am
#> # A tibble: 3 x 3
#> # Groups:   cyl [3]
#>     cyl   `0`   `1`
#> * <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1  4.00  22.9  28.1
#> 2  6.00  19.1  20.6
#> 3  8.00  15.0  15.4
```

Now to `adorn_` it. Since this is not a result of a `tabyl()` call, it
doesn’t have the underlying Ns stored in the `core` attribute, so we’ll
have to supply them:

``` r
mpg_by_cyl_and_am %>%
  adorn_rounding() %>%
  adorn_ns(
    ns = mtcars %>% # calculate the Ns on the fly by calling tabyl on the original data
      tabyl(cyl, am)
  ) %>%
  adorn_title("combined", row_name = "Cylinders", col_name = "Is Automatic")
#>   Cylinders/Is Automatic         0        1
#> 1                      4 22.9  (3) 28.1 (8)
#> 2                      6 19.1  (4) 20.6 (3)
#> 3                      8 15.1 (12) 15.4 (2)
```

Or you could tinker with the Ns before appending them, e.g., if you have
large Ns in a tabyl, divide them by 1000, round, and append “k” before
calling `adorn_ns`.
